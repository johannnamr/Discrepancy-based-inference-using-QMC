# Discrepancy-based-inference-for-generative-models-using-QMC
This repository contains the python code to recreate the numerical experiments in the paper "Discrepancy-based Inference for Generative Models using QMC" by Ziang Niu, Johanna Meier and Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol. It is optimised for the use with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and mounts the Google drive to load other required notebooks located in the default folder for Colab notebooks. For local use, file paths have to be adjusted where indicated.

Generating vectors and matrices for lattices:<br> 
- *lattice_vec.600.20.npy* for order-2 lattice<br> 
- *lattice_vec.600.13.npy* for order-8 lattice<br> 
The files are taken from Dirk Nuyens' [Magic Point Shop](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~dirk.nuyens/qmc-generators/)
