# Discrepancy-based-inference-for-generative-models-using-QMC
Python code to recreate the results of the paper "Discrepancy-based Inference for Generative Models using QMC" by Ziang Niu, Johanna Meier and Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol. It is optimised for the use with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and mounts the Google drive to load required other notebooks located in the default folder for Colab notebooks. For local use, file paths have to be adjusted where indicated.
